        <p>Seattle's sports history began at the start of the 20th century with the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA)'s Seattle Metropolitans, which in 1917 became the first American hockey team to win the Stanley Cup. Seattle's sports history continues today with the city's eight major professional teams: the National Football League (NFL)'s Seattle Seahawks, Major League Baseball (MLB)'s Seattle Mariners, National Hockey League (NHL)'s Seattle Kraken, Major League Soccer (MLS)'s Seattle Sounders FC, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA)'s Seattle Storm, the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL)'s OL Reign, Major League Rugby (MLR)'s Seattle Seawolves, and the XFL's Seattle Dragons. Seattle also boasts a strong history in collegiate sports, with two National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I schools: the University of Washington and Seattle University, and one NCAA Division II school, Seattle Pacific University.</p>
